## Resolution: How to set jumping links in GitHub Markdown

You can link headings simply as follows:

```python
[Description](#NAME-OF-HEADING)
```

**Note:** if the name of the heading has more than one word, join words with `-` (which is essential).

### Example

The contents below simulate a realistic format, as expected.

<br>

---

## Contents

- [Shining Watermelon](#Shining-Watermelon)
  - [Introduction from IMDb](#Introduction-from-IMDb)

```python
- [Shining Watermelon](#Shining-Watermelon)
```

**Note:** `Ctrl` + `left_click` will bring you a trip.

Several empty lines assure apparent responses. (just for illustration)

## Shining Watermelon

### Introduction from IMDb

> Shining Watermelon (Sparkling Watermelon) will tell the story of a boy living a double life between a model student and a band member who gets to time slip and meets his 18-year-old father. The two will build friendships there.

As far as I am concerned, the plots therein are much better than introduced. It is exciting and worth watching.
