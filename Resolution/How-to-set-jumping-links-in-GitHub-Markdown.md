## Resolution: How to set jumping links in GitHub Markdown

You can link headings simply as follows:

```python
[Description](#NAME-OF-HEADING)
```

**Note:** if the name of the heading has more than one word, join words with `-` (which is essential).

### Example

The contents below simulate a realistic format, as expected.

  - [Introduction from Wikipedia](#Introduction-from-Wikipedia)

```python
- [Shining Watermelon](#Shining-Watermelon)
    - [Description from IMDb](#Description-from-IMDb)
    - [Introduction from Wikipedia](#Introduction-from-Wikipedia)
```

**Note:** `Ctrl` + `left_click` will bring you a smooth trip.

As far as I am concerned, the plots therein are much better than introduced. It is exciting and worth watching.
