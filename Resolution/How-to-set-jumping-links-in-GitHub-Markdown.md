## Resolution: How to set jumping links in GitHub Markdown

You can link headings simply as follows:

```python
[Description](#NAME-OF-HEADING)
```

**Note:** if the name of the heading has more than one word, join words with `-` (which is essential).

### Example

The contents below simulate a realistic format, as expected.
