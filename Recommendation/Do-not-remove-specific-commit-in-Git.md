## Recommendation:  Do not remove specific commits in Git

The best way to remove specific commits in Git is not to do it at all. Commits help us record changes to the repository. It should not be removed by any means.

However, if you are still attempting to do it (e.g. remedy rather inappropriate behaviors), see [here](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit), [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10911317/how-to-remove-the-first-commit-in-git), and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2938301/remove-specific-commit) for help.
