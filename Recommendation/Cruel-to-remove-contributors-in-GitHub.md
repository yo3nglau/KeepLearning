## Recommendation: Cruel to remove contributors in GitHub

### Forbidden: Remove working contributors

Contributors should be respected for their efforts to make the repository better, the removal is cruel and forbidden.

### Possible: Remove detached contributors

If you are removing contributors who no longer contribute to the repository and ensure the contribution they ever made is removed, the removal is possible.

### Possible: Remove unexpected contributors

In a specific case, if you have multiple GitHub accounts (possibly for different kinds of projects or purposes) and accidentally pushed commits using the wrong account, the removal is possible.

## Resolution

For the last two possible situations, you can [change the branch name](/Resolution/How-to-rename-a-branch-in-GitHub.md) and change it back to update the contributor list (otherwise, potentially cached by GitHub), [as suggested](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69294044). This is possibly the most straightforward way compared to [other methods](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/49813).
